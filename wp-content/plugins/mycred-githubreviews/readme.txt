== Description ==


myCred Github is a myCred integrated add-on that enables the admin to award points based on the approval of their user’s pull request respective to the master branch of the project.


The admin has to define the repository (for which the points will be awarded) from the back-end settings. You can also set limits on the number of points a user can earn by selecting the following options:


* No Limit - the user can earn unlimited points at any time.
* Day - The user can earn points a limited amount of points in a day.
* Week - The user can earn points a limited amount of points in a week.
* Month - The user can earn points a limited amount of points in a month.
* In Total - The user can earn points a limited amount of points in total.


You can also define the number of points a user can gain after each successful pull request.

There is a shortcode [connect-with-github] for account authorization that can be placed on any page/post. After landing on the page, the user has to click on the “GitHub Reconnect” link, which will redirect them to a pre-defined page using Connect Redirect URL.

Furthermore, the admin can view the total entries (points given to users) from the repositories entry log.
